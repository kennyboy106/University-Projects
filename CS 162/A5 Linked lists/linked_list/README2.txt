Description:
	This program creates a list of nodes that are linked together. Each nodes
	contains a piece of data and the address of the next node in the list. At the
	end of the list, the node will point to NULL.
	This program provides functions to:
	print linked lists
	clear linked lists
	add elements to the front or back
	insert elements to the list
	sort the list in descending or ascending order
	count prime numbers in the list excluding negative numbers

Instructions:
	open the terminal in the folder and run:
		make
	Then use
		./run
	and follow the instructions of the program to step through the process.

Limitations:
	You cannot insert elements if your index is larger than the list itself
	You can only store integers in the nodes
	Negative numbers don't count as primes
